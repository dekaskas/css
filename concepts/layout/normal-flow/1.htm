        <p>One <span>Nevmber</span> night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two
    brothers sat over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay,
    watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their
    names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
    were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interst in all scientific
    knowledge and new discovery</p>
        <p>Before that that nightâ€”<strong>a memorable night</strong>, as it was to prove-hundreds 0f
    millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without
    drawing any special inspiration from the fact.</p>
